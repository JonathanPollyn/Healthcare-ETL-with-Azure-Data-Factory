## Introduction

Healthcare organizations frequently need help managing vast quantities of data from many sources. This repository provides pre-configured pipelines, templates, and software that can enhance the efficiency of data transfer, conversion, and loading operations utilizing Azure Data Factory and SSIS. These solutions effectively combine cloud-based and on-premise systems, simplifying the task of healthcare providers in ensuring data integrity, accuracy, and compliance. 

## Features

- **Hybrid ETL Solutions:** Integrated data workflows using Azure Data Factory and SSIS for cloud and on-premise environments.
- **Data Ingestion:** Pipelines to ingest data from various healthcare data sources and on-premise databases.
- **Data Transformation:** Scripts and activities for cleaning, transforming, and standardizing healthcare data in the cloud and on-premise.
- **Data Integration:** End-to-end solutions that integrate data across multiple healthcare systems, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
- **Security and Compliance:** Best practices for handling sensitive healthcare data, including encryption, data masking, and HIPAA compliance.
- **Scalability:** Solutions designed to handle large volumes of data, whether hosted on-premise or in the cloud.

## Architecture

The architecture in this repository follows a modular, hybrid design that supports both cloud-based and on-premise workflows:

- **Data Sources:** Various healthcare data sources include on-premise databases, APIs, file systems, and cloud storage.
- **ADF Pipelines & SSIS Packages:** Pre-built pipelines for data ingestion, transformation, and loading using Azure Data Factory and SSIS.
- **Data Storage:** Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake, SQL databases, or on-premise storage for staging and storing data.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Integrated monitoring tools to track pipeline execution and log errors across both environments.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying any solution, ensure you have the following:

- An active Azure subscription (for ADF and cloud deployments)
- SQL Server Integration Services (for on-premise and hybrid deployments)
- Proper permissions to create and manage resources in Azure and on-premise
- Basic knowledge of Azure services, particularly ADF, and familiarity with SSIS

## Setup and Deployment

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JonathanPollyn/Healthcare-ETL-with-Azure-Data-Factory-and-SSIS.git
2. Configure Azure Resources:

- Set up necessary Azure services (e.g., Azure Data Factory, Azure SQL Database, Azure Blob Storage).
- For SSIS, configure your on-premise SQL Server and SSIS environment.
3. Deploy Pipelines and Packages:

- Follow the instructions in the deployment folder to deploy ADF pipelines to your Azure environment.
- Deploy SSIS packages to your on-premise SQL Server or host them in Azure Data Factory via Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime.
4. Run Pipelines:

- Trigger the pipelines and packages manually or schedule them according to your requirements.
## Usage
General usage involves:

- Setting up data sources and destinations.
- Running the pipeline for data movement.
- Monitor and troubleshoot issues across both cloud and on-premise setups.
## Examples
- Patient Data Ingestion: A pipeline that ingests patient data from CSV files and loads it into Azure SQL Database.
- Pharmacy Data Integration: A solution for consolidating data from multiple pharmacies into Azure SQL Database and on-premise systems.
- Generic Data Ingestion: SSIS package that loads generic medication names.
- Outpatient Data Ingestion: SSIS package that loads hospital outpatient data.
- Hybrid ETL Workflow: Combining SSIS on-premise packages with ADF pipelines for a seamless data engineering solution.
