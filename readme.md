## Introduction

Healthcare organizations frequently encounter difficulties administering vast amounts of data from various sources. This repository offers pre-built pipelines, templates, and programs that can be employed to optimize data movement, transformation, and loading processes with Azure Data Factory.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:** Pipelines to ingest data from various healthcare data sources, including EHR systems, HL7 feeds, and medical devices.
- **Data Transformation:** Scripts and activities for cleaning, transforming, and standardizing healthcare data.
- **Data Integration:** Solutions to integrate data across multiple healthcare systems, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
- **Security and Compliance:** Best practices for handling sensitive healthcare data, including encryption and data masking.
- **Scalability:** Solutions designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

## Architecture

Each solution in this repository follows a modular architecture, making it easy to adapt to specific needs. The architecture typically includes:

- **Data Sources:** Various healthcare data sources such as databases, APIs, and file systems.
- **ADF Pipelines:** Pre-built pipelines for data ingestion, transformation, and loading.
- **Data Storage:** Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake, or other storage services for staging and storing data.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Integrated monitoring to track pipeline execution and log errors.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying any solution, ensure you have the following:

- An active Azure subscription
- Access to Azure Data Factory
- Proper permissions to create and manage resources in Azure
- Basic knowledge of Azure services, particularly Azure Data Factory

## Setup and Deployment

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - git clone git clone https://github.com/JonathanPollyn/Healthcare-ETL-with-Azure-Data-Factory.git
## Configure Azure Resources:
- Set up necessary Azure services (e.g., Azure Data Factory, Azure Storage, etc.).
- Update configuration files with your Azure environment details.
## Deploy Pipelines:
Follow the instructions in the deployment folder to deploy pipelines to your Azure Data Factory instance.
## Run Pipelines:
Trigger the pipelines manually or set up a schedule according to your needs.
## Usage
General usage involves:
- Setting up data sources and destinations.
- Running the pipeline for data movement.
- Monitoring and troubleshooting any issues.
## Examples
- Patient Data Ingestion: A pipeline that ingests patient data from comma-separated values (csv) and loads it into Azure SQL Database.
 Pharmacy Data: A solution for integrating data from multiple pharmacy data into Azure SQL Database.
